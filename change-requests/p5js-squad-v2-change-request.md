- enemy move in straight line
- enemy spawn in rows, full the main lane width
- squad has faster, stronger bullet
- power-up lane spaw "mirror+1" continueously, keep the squad max at 20 members even eat more mirror (configurable)
- power-up lane spaw continously things
- enymy spaws continuous
- the game is easy, but spawn is fast to have good feeling


help me update
- game start without press "enter", just for debug time, now the game show up and started
- game has pause button, on the right top corner
- enemy when come to base line 50 far from squad, will go directly into the squad to kill the squad, which may the squad need to be stronger and have to kill all enemy
- no enemy go pass through squad, they all at near end close to squad, go directly to them
- bridge now from bottom to middle of the screen, bridge MUST from button to top of the screen
- skills in power-up lane like: "shoot faster +3", "shoot stronger +4", "shoot aoe +2" is accumulative overtime
- give me more skills like that with different UI
- implement skills: a, s, d, f and q, w, e, r you missing that

help me update
- increase squad health (configurable), at least in debug mode, we can easily try all the power-up skills
- bridge now from bottom to middle of the screen, NOW, bridge MUST from button to top of the screen, make the game more space to play and view
- squad more and more member in horizontal row first, 2/3 of bridge width, before stack vertical
- skills: "a,s,d,f,q,w,e,r" when cast has error
- bullet when fsater, stronger, more aoe need different UI and effects


help me update:
- Context: bridge already longer (2/3 of the screen), please update to 5/6 or full of the screen hieght to increase much longer bridge
- Context: bridge already longer, however, the squad has contraint of last implement, can't go deep down further on the bridge, please update to allow squad to go anywhere on the bridge
- allow me in debug mode can easily go to next wave, like killed 10 enemy only, then move to next wave, each wave how many enemy to kill should be configurable map, and in debug mode, it's easy with 10
- power-up items always at middle of power-up line, spawn more "mirro +1" items, like every 1 "mirror +1" item every 0.5s, continuously
- squad has leader, mark in different color
